    <h1>Food Recovery Network</h1>
    <p class="desc">We are a club doing what we can to reduce food waste and help make RPI more sustainable by
        transporting excess food from on campus dining locations to our communtiny Partners. Our chapter was founded in
        2018 and we are supported by a <a href="https://www.foodrecoverynetwork.org/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">national office</a> that helps FRN chapters across the nation reduce food waste nation-wide.
        Our club currently picks up from Panera, Commons, Sage, and special events typically ones with catering. We
        currently donate all our food donations to <a aria-label="Joesph's House of Troy"
            href="https://www.josephshousetroy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joesph's House</a> in downtown Troy.
    </p><br>
    <p class="desc">If you're interested in joining our <a aria-label="Join our Discord"
            href="https://discord.gg/bDgmaaRkHw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> is where we will share all
        the events that we are hosting along with sign up
        sheets for picking up food. Through out the semester we try to host some workshops and events to learn more
        about food waste and how we can make a difference in our personal lives and through volunteering.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-gap">Captain</h2>
    <p class="desc">Every pick up has a designated captain either an E-Board member or a volunteer with a car. They are
        in charge of driving the food to the destination and completing our <a aria-label="recovery report form"
            href="https://forms.gle/DjNWiakBvWxTQN8Q8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recovery Form</a> to help us log
        every recovery.</p>
    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <p class="desc">Volunteers do not need a car and are there to help the captain move food. While Panera only
        typically gives us 1 box per night big donations from Dining Halls or catering events can produce many trays of
        food that we need help moving to vehicles and to our community partners facilities.</p>
    <h2>Request a pickup</h2>
    <p class="desc">We are also able to pick up food from catered events. We ask that organizations <a
            aria-label="donation request form" href="https://forms.gle/yXHcPTbtY2uAbnmPA" rel="noopener"
            target="_blank">let us know
            through our form</a> as early as possible with a preference of at least 2 weeks in advance. We also require
        the food to be food safe for example items can't have been open on a buffet where no food workers could access
        it. If you have questions feel free to <a aria-label="Email Food Recovery Network"
